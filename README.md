### Sr. Technical Systems Administrator | Automation Goblin

I'm a ~~jaded~~ ~~worn-out~~ seasoned Technical Systems Administrator with a passion for automation, gaming, and building cool things. My work focuses on creating efficient systems, implementing cutting-edge technologies, and simplifying complex workflows. Outside of work, I'm an avid gamer and enjoy diving into both computer and tabletop games. I tend to try to automate everything I touch, for better or worse.


### 🛠️ **My Toolbox & Skills**

- **Programming Languages & Scripting**: 🐍 Python, 🐚 PowerShell (7+ only), Bash, 🌍 JavaScript

- **Automation & DevOps**: 🐳 Docker (love me some Compose), 🚀 Building CI/CD pipelines, 😓 spending 5h to automate 1-2 5m tasks...

- **Configuration Management**: 🪆 Puppet, ☠️ DSC, every other one...

- **Cloud & Infrastructure**: 🌋 Terraform, ☁️ Google Cloud, ⛅ Azure, 💩 VMware

- **Monitoring & Security**: 🪵 ELK, 🔥 Prometheus, 💸 Splunk, 🦋 Grafana

- **Databases, Caches, & Queues**: 🐘 PostgreSQL, 💩 MySQL, 🍃 MongoDB, accidentally touching a hot stove...


### 🔄 **Current Projects & Interests**

- 🌍 **Edge Extensions**: Developing Microsoft Edge extensions to automate repeat tasks and keep useful information readily-available. I do 80% of my work in a browser between work/personal/projects, and therefore want to bring as much quality-of-life to my browser environment as possible.

- 💬 **Discord Apps & Utilities**: Creating useful tools that improve user (and moderator) experience.

- 🛜 **Home Network**: Improving the infrastructure, monitoring, and management tools in my local network. I've been deploying an unreasonable amount of services to make it easy to work, learn, and relax.
