### Oh, Hello 👋

- 🧰 I’m constantly working on expanding/refining an arsenal of tools. Maybe I should get around to listing them here 🤔.
- 🧠 I’m currently learning [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (before it becomes uncool). I love how ubiquitous JavaScript is, and the maintainability of TypeScript is a great prospect.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything, usually whatever my friends are enthusiastic about or need help with.
- 💬 Ask me about PowerShell! I love writing modules to solve a specific set of problems, be it interacting with APIs of existing tools or automating tasks (it's compulsive at this point).
- 🛠️ I've written tools for everything under then sun: troubleshooting, development, automation, and change management workflows.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I still haven't settled on a fun fact.
